  # CSS-Journey

Welcome to my CSS learning journey! In this repository, I document my progress, experiments, and insights as I dive into the world of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, I hope you find something useful here.

## Repository Structure

- **HTML Files**: Each HTML file corresponds to a specific CSS style. For example:
  - `CSS1.html`: Associated with `style1.css`
  - `CSS2.html`: Associated with `style2.css`
  - ...

- **CSS Files**: These files contain the actual styles. Feel free to explore them and see how different properties and selectors work.

## Notes

I've added detailed comments within the CSS files to explain my thought process, challenges, and solutions. If you're curious about a particular style, check the corresponding HTML file for context.

## Contributions

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to submit pull requests or open issues. Let's learn and grow together!

Happy coding! ðŸŽ¨ðŸš€
